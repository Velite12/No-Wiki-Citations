# No-Wiki-Citations

 An edge extension that disables citations on Wikipedia pages, for ease of use when using a voice reader. To enable, click on the extension and activate the toggle when on the desired page.

 Normally, when using a voice reader, it will read the citation numbers before periods as "point 7" instead of ignoring it like a sentence that just ends in a period. Then it reads the next sentence without pause. This remedies this issue and makes the voice reader flow more naturally.

 To run this, download the code, and follow the steps for sideloading an edge extension: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading
